Directory created 8/4/20 for the 
grain boundary algorithm.

The file example.m contains an example
for using the algorithm.

Before running the example, call

mex mainMatlab.cpp

If you get an error, then 
you probably need to download a mex
compiler for Matlab. The easiest way
to do this is to go into Add-Ons 
and download MinGW.
