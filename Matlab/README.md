Directory created 8/4/20 for the 
grain boundary algorithm.

The file example.m contains an example
for using the algorithm with a single
image. ex_nchannel.m has an example
for running the algorithm with multiple
images.

Before running the example, call

mex mainMatlab.cpp

If you get an error, then 
you probably need to download a mex
compiler for Matlab. The easiest way
to do this on windows is to go into 
Add-Ons and download MinGW. On MacOS
just install Xcode or the Xcode 
command-line tools.
